# emoji-tools

this is a script i made to build emoji packs for mastodon

`emoji_settings.json` drives `build_spritesheet.py`

`emoji_pretty.json` comes from [emoji-data](https://github.com/iamcal/emoji-data/blob/master/emoji_pretty.json)

it's supposed to copy all found emoji to `../public/emoji` and build a spritesheet based on `emoji_pretty.json`

**work in progress!!** does not build spritesheet yet, only find and copy emoji files

emoji svgs are not uploaded to this repo cause they're big. supply your own!
